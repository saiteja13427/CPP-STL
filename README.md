# C++ - STL

This is a repository of various header files which can be used to include various data structures into your C++ program.

## Why?

If we use STL, **we don't have control over the data structure** in case we want to customise anything, right?

But here, you can get access to all header file code and you can just modify the file as per your requirement and it is good to go.

## How to Use?

To use any datastructure

1. Clone the repository
2. Pick the datastructure you need.
3. Move the header file to the location of your program.
4. Include it in your program and you are good to go.
5. The documentation for every data structure is present in a separate readme in respective folder.
